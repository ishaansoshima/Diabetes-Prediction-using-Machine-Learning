# Diabetes-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning

## Project Description

This project aims to predict whether a person has diabetes or not based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. The project utilizes a machine learning approach, specifically the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm, to make the predictions. The implementation is done in Python using Jupyter Notebook.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the PIMA Indian Diabetes Dataset, which is sourced from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. It consists of several medical predictor variables and one target variable, Outcome, which indicates whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

## Dependencies

The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn
```

## Results
The notebook includes steps for data collection and analysis, data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) model is trained and tested, and its accuracy is computed to assess its performance.
